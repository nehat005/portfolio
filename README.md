Hello, I am Neha Tandon.

Solving your PEBKAC from ML perspective :) 

## Summary
Hello, I am a Machine Learning engineer at [Linguwerk](https://www.linguwerk.de/) where I work on Automatic Speech Recognition and Speaker Recognition. Coming from Signal Processing background, I am passionate to integrate ML with real-world problems and bringing to businesses an enhanced understanding of integrated AI technology with creative visualizations! 

I have a Masters degree in Machine Learning from the Department of Computer Science at the University of TÃ¼bingen. During my Masters, I worked as a research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems working with Joerg Stueckler on custom robot design and simulation in the domain of Computer Vision.

What I do as an ML Engineer 
 - feature space development and filtering
 - topology review and development
 - configuring parameter space and optimization
 - prototype and create first results
 - scale the technology to requirements and provide ML trainings
 - provide application-relevant results and conclusions
 - containerize the app for server deployments

When not working, you'll usually find me playing Badminton or watching Netflix.

Key achievement: Spearheaded the concept, development and deployment of a standalone speaker identification feature that significantly enhanced user experience of flagship speech-to-text technology.
